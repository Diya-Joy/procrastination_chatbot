### Project Description
Procrastination Coach is a fun and quirky chatbot that encourages users to procrastinate creatively with funny excuses and playful prompts. It turns wasting time into an entertaining experience while keeping track of how long you‚Äôve avoided work.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Everyone is way too productive these days, leaving no time to master the fine art of procrastination. Our project solves this ‚Äúproblem‚Äù by giving people a fun excuse to delay work with style and humor!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a chatbot that cheerfully convinces you to put off your tasks with hilarious excuses, useless facts, and silly games‚Äîmaking procrastination feel like a full-time job!
